Greenlight is an open-source client for xCloud and Xbox home streaming made in Javascript and Typescript. The client is an application wrapper around [xbox-xcloud-player](https://github.com/unknownskl/xbox-xcloud-player).
The application runs on Linux, macOS, Windows and Steam Deck.

## About this fork

This is a fork of [unknownskl/greenlight](https://github.com/unknownskl/greenlight), extended with features [Better xCloud](https://github.com/redphx/better-xcloud) has that Greenlight didn't.

**Added:**
- **Clarity Boost.** CSS-filter video sharpening. Adjustable strength in Settings > Video & Audio.
- **Custom touch layouts.** Three presets (Standard, Racing, Minimal) for on-screen touch controls. Selectable in Settings > Input.
- **Screenshot capture.** Gamebar button or the `P` key. Saves to `~/Pictures/Greenlight/`.
- **Local co-op (Remote Play only).** A second locally-connected controller can join as another player. Opt-in toggle in Settings > Input, off by default. This needed a fix in the `xbox-xcloud-player` dependency itself (see `patches/`): a `return` where the code meant `continue` was silently skipping multi-controller detection.
- **Graceful stream-negotiation errors.** `setRemoteOffer()` now properly catches a failed `setRemoteDescription()` instead of losing the rejection to an ineffective synchronous `try/catch`, so a negotiation failure shows a clean message instead of crashing with an unhandled rejection.

**Dependency patch:** this fork uses [`patch-package`](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package) to fix the local co-op bug in `xbox-xcloud-player@0.2.11` without forking that package outright. The patch lives in `patches/` and applies automatically on install.

## Keyboard controls

Keys are mapped as following by default:

    Dpad: Keypad direction controls
    Buttons: A, B, X, Y, Backspace (Mapped as B), Enter (Mapped as A)
    Nexus (Xbox button): N

    Left Trigger: -
    Right Trigger: =

## Streaming stats

During the stream you can show debug statistics that contain extra data about the buffer queues and other information. To bring this up you can press `~` on your keyboard.

At the bottom-left you can see the status (although not always accurate). At the top-right you can find the FPS of the video and audio decoders including the latency. At the bottom-right you can find debug information about the buffer queues and other information that is useful for debugging perposes.

When possible always provide this information with your issue, if it is related.

## Online friends list

The application also provides a way to see which of your friends are online. This can be useful when you want to quickly check if anyone is online to play with :)

## Steam Deck Setup

This application is reported to be working on the Steam Deck with some small bugs and side-effects. You can map one of the Steam Deck back buttons to the 'N' key to simulate the Xbox button.

## Optional launch arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| --fullscreen | Starts the application in fullscreen |
| --connect=<value> | Will start stream once the user is authenticated. |

For console use `F000000000000000` format and for xCloud use `xcloud_<title>`.
